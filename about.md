A bit about this project:
Vonvoo was created as a solution for the countless people that:
   - Cannot remember their passwords, which means that they are likely:
      - bad and reused passwords
   - Can remember their passwords, which means that they are likely:
      - bad and reused passwords
   - Lost their phone and could not recover critical assets on a new device
   - Unable to access their accounts without the phone number from their cell phone plan
   - Have been hacked or completely owned
   - Wish to be more immune to [`Digital Asset Fragility`](./_posts/2023-04-05-Digital-Asset-Fragility.md)

**Claim**: It should be plainly stated that without unique, lengthy and complex passwords and without 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled, we should expect our digital assets to be breached.

**Problem**: Our brains are not effective at meeting these requirements.

   - Our brains are effective at building and using tools - not for remembering good passwords.

**Environment**: We a have a plethora of economical and free tools at our disposal.

**Solution**: Follow this thorough guide that leverages good software. Then adapt to relying on these tools and get back to enjoying life.

**Benefits**: Know that you have:
   
   - Elevated your digital security posture.
   - A recovery plan in place and how to use it.
