subtitle: How securing digital assets properly also protects against losing digital assets

#### Common scenarios demonstrate this.
Using your laptop in the living room.

Walking to a café.

Visiting friends for the weekend.

Traveling.
##### Current Technical posture:
Might be already signed into email on the laptop and phone with the passwords saved to the browser’s built in password saver. Your passwords are synced to your devices through this browser account, or Google account, or iCloud Keychain.

Your bank 2FA codes are sent to the phone number tied to your physical SIM card in the phone.

###### Relatively common events:
There is a fire in the apartment and digital devices are destroyed. 

Your bag, containing both devices, is stolen on the way to the café, friend’s house or while on vacation. Or your bag is drenched in rain along the way.

These scenarios result in your digital devices being unavailable or defective.

###### Recovery attempt:
Purchase another cellphone, but that physical SIM card from the old phone is also damaged or is not available due to theft. This means that you won't be able to log into your bank app because many banks refuse to modernize their 2FA codes away from SMS. If you are not close your cellphone provider’s store (when traveling), you are now locked out of your banking apps.

Try to log into your Google/iCloud account and gain access to email. You may remember that password or not, but either way cannot sign in, because Google will prompt for the 2FA code when logging in on the new device. Since you have no device with access to this account (or it’s 2FA), this means no password sync, no email.

You may be in a location where an iPhone is not available to purchase. 

You may have been using a Password Manager, like Keepass and cloud-synced over Dropbox - same scenario with Google account access. This is another lock-out scenario because Dropbox will send you an email for logging into a new device. With no access to that email account, there is no access to that Keepass File.

###### Summary:
Simply losing your daily devices can result in a total lock-out scenario of all your Digital Assets. This includes your contacts (phone numbers of your support system), email, banking and all others. 

This can be a temporary inconvenience, a loss of all accounts and starting over with no history, or even a significant security risk to your person. Maybe you have another old laptop at home that is still logged into your email or maybe not.

Any convenient ‘save’, where you find an old phone or laptop that is already logged into your important accounts might seem lucky, but this would be an example of a poor security posture.

#### The Same common scenarios apply.

##### Excellent security posture (Vonvoo Method)
All password are saved to the Password Manager (Bitwarden).

Your email 2FA - and all other account 2FA - is in the Authenticator App (Ente Auth).

Bank 2FA codes are sent to your Primacy Virtual Phone Number (Google Voice or the best app for your Country or scenario).

###### The relatively common events from above are the same.
###### Recovery process:
Purchase any cellphone with Emergency Cash. You have the liberty to purchase a phone of any available platform (Android, iOS, etc) because your data is Platform Independent.

Install and log into Bitwarden and as expected, it is prompting for a 2FA code. Since this is the planned [Disaster Recovery Scenario](https://docs.vonvoo.com/en/latest/password%20manager%20continued.html "Disaster Recovery Scenario"), you have the Bitwarden Recovery Code printed on the back of your laminated Emergency Card in your wallet and travel belt. Log into Bitwarden in the browser and enter the Recovery Code to temporarily disable 2FA. Now log into the Bitwarden app on the phone. 

Install and log into app Ente Auth. Now in the browser, in the Bitwarden account, re-enable 2FA and then log out.

Bonus, you also download you eSIM and now also have access to this phone number and data plan as well. Or if you have no eSIM, any physical SIM can be inserted into the phone, because your Critical Digital Assets, like Banking, are associated to the Virtual Phone Number.

###### Summary:
You have now completely recovered your Critical (and all) Digital Assets and can continue with the life.
##### This is how digital security, when properly implemented, guards against Digital Asset Fragility.
